# Space Wars: X-Wing vs Death Star

A 3D space shooter game where players pilot an X-wing fighter on a mission to destroy the Death Star.

## Project Overview

Space Wars is a browser-based 3D game built with Three.js that recreates the iconic trench run scene from Star Wars. Players navigate through the Death Star's surface, avoid obstacles and enemy fire, and ultimately attempt to hit the thermal exhaust port to destroy the Death Star.

## Features (Planned)

- 3D environment with the Death Star surface and trench
- Controllable X-wing fighter with realistic flight physics
- Enemy TIE fighters and turret defenses
- Collision detection and damage system
- Power-ups and special abilities
- Sound effects and background music
- Score tracking and high score system

## Development Roadmap

### Phase 1: Basic Setup and Environment
- Set up the project structure and dependencies
- Create a basic 3D scene with Three.js
- Implement camera controls and basic rendering

### Phase 2: Player Ship and Controls
- Create or import an X-wing 3D model
- Implement player controls (keyboard/mouse)
- Add basic flight physics and boundaries

### Phase 3: Death Star Environment
- Create the Death Star surface environment
- Design the trench run path
- Add obstacles and collision detection

### Phase 4: Combat System
- Add weapons system for the X-wing
- Implement enemy TIE fighters with basic AI
- Add turret defenses along the trench

### Phase 5: Game Logic
- Create game states (start, play, game over)
- Implement scoring system
- Add win/lose conditions

### Phase 6: Polish and Refinement
- Add sound effects and music
- Implement visual effects (explosions, laser blasts)
- Optimize performance
- Add menu and instructions

## Technologies

- HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- Three.js for 3D rendering
- WebGL for graphics acceleration
- Howler.js for sound management (optional)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser with WebGL support
- Node.js and npm (for development)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/spacewars.git
   cd spacewars
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the development server
   ```
   npm start
   ```

4. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`

## Controls (Planned)

- **W/A/S/D** or **Arrow Keys**: Control the X-wing movement
- **Mouse**: Aim/adjust flight direction
- **Space**: Fire weapons
